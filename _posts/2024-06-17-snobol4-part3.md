# Some Basic Syntax

The format of a statement is

```
[label]  code [: branches] [sequence]
```
Where

- `label` is an optional statement label
- `code` is what it says, must be preceded by whitespace if no label
- `branches` are the optional success/fail options
- `sequence` is an optional sequence number

You won't use the sequence nowadays. You could put sequence numbers into columns 72-80 of an 80 column punched card, and this could help you put your program back into the right order should you accidentally drop it on the floor.

A statement with an asterisk in column 1 is a comment; you can't add comments to the end of code lines.

The basic types are there, integers, floats and strings, and usual arithmetic operators. The set also includes exponentiation, denoted by `**` or (rather confusingly) `!`. Like Python, string literals can be enclosed in single or double quotes, as long as they match,

There's no explicit typing, and values are converted as appropriate. If a string represents a number, it can be used in arithmetic expressions like so, where `X` ends up with the value `-39.4`:

```
    Z = '10'
    X = 5 * -Z + '10.6'
```
Strings are concatenated by separating them with spaces, and numbers will be converted and concatenated into the string, like this:

```
  ROW = 'K'
  NO. = 22
  SEAT = ROW NO.
```
Which ends up with `SEAT` having the value `'K22'`. 

> Variable names must start with a letter, and can consist of letters, numerals, underscore and period
