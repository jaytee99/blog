Before delving into the language and how to get it running, here are some resources. For a 40 year-old language it's remarkably well documented:

- "A SNOBOL4 Tutorial" at http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/snobol/vtutor/contents.htm
- "The SNOBOL4 Programming Language" book, known as the "Green Book", is available as a PDF from several sources, including here: http://worrydream.com/refs/Griswold-TheSnobolProgrammingLanguage.pdf

The original code ran on all sorts of machines and operating systems that no longer exist, but there's a C version that'll run on modern machines. I've installed it on Mac OS using `homebrew`, and there are versions available for other operating systems as well.

A first try at using it looks encouraging:

```
12:13 ~ $ snobol4 -h
CSNOBOL4 version 1.5 (October 1, 2013)
built Thu Sep 21 03:46:15 BST 2017
Usage: snobol4 [options...] [files...] [parameters...]
```
And that's followed by a whole lot of options. So far so good.

My simplest test program, `test1.sno`, just copies input to output:

```
LOOP  OUTPUT = INPUT : S(LOOP)
END
Line 1
Line 2
Last Line
```

The `END` line marks the end of the program. Imagine that your code and data is all in one deck of cards; you need a way to signal the end of the code, and everything that comes after that is data. I can run this with the `-r` option that tells it to look for the input data after `END`. Here's what I see when running it:

```
$ snobol4 -r test1.sno

No errors detected in source program

Line 1
Line 2
Last Line
Normal termination at level 0
test1.sno:1: Last statement executed was 1
```
That's a it long-winded, so I can suppress all the extra output using the `-b` option, which just shows me the output:

```
$ snobol4 -rb test1.sno
Line 1
Line 2
Last Line
```
If you don't use `-r` it will read from standard input and ignore the data after `END`.
