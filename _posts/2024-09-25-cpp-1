# 1. The Territory

## A Very Brief History

In the beginning was Bjarne Stroustrup and his PhD project.

In the early 90s the language was put forward for standardization, and so Stroustrup gave up his control in favour of the Standard Committee.

## Versions!

There are versions back in ancient history that you're very unlikely to come across (for example, Borland,Zortech)

The first major change to C++ came with the release of the first ISO standard in 1998, and so unsurprisingly this version is called **C++98**. This was followed in 2003 by the relatively minor update of **C++03**.

There then followed a long period while the next update to the standard was being prepared, and this wasn't available until 2011. **C++11** was a major update, and I'll have a lot more to say about that in due course.

The Standard Committee decided that eight years was too long between updates, and so they decided on a three year release schedule, with the aim of alternating major and minor releases.

It turned out that **C++14** and **C++17** were minor releases, with **C++20** being the next major release. As I write in Autumn 2024, there have been some releases of **C++23**, but it isn't widely in use yet.

## What Are You Going To Come Across?

If you've come from Java, C# or any of several other languages, one thing you may find surprising is the lack of standardization with regard to things like naming, code layout, project structure, and even file names and extensions. You'll see source files with `.cpp`, `.cxx` and `.C` extensions (and maybe others that I haven't come across).

Languages like Java and C# sprang into being complete with large standard libraries, and that - along with the use of a runtime - imposed a standard way of writing and arranging code. There was no such thing in the early C++ world, and so there wasn't a standard library until... well, until the first standard was released.

There is a lot of older C++ code in the enterprise world, and you are very likely to come across large C++98 and C++03 codebases.
